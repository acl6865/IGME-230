<h2>Concept</h2>

___

Point and click combat game where you take turns on offence and defence.
While on offence, click an enemy's weak points to deal damage. While on defence, click an enemy's attack to block them.

The screen will be split into a grid (for simplicity, a 3x3 grid). Enemies will fill most of the grid. Selecting a square that houses an enemy deals damage. Clicking on a square without an enemy or that has an enemy's defence icon will result in the attack missing or being blocked.

Types of enemies:

* Enemy with Shield

   Has a moving shield to block player attacks. Shield follows after the mouse at varying speeds. Click anywhere but the shield to deal damage.
   Ex) Knight, Orc, Skeleton
   
* Fast Enemy

   Moves around the screen, trying to dodge the cursor. Clicking anywhere on the enemy deals damage.
   Ex) Slime, Dragoon, Goblin

The game's setting will be traditional fantasy (knights, magicians, and slimes).
Art will be simplistic pixel-designed such that enemies' art is clearly within the grid that they house but still fills the grid squares.
